# etch-a-sketch-vanilla-js
This project is a part of "The Odin Project" curriculum. The main goal was "to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.". To create it, I used:

<ul>
<li>Vanilla JS, HTML5 and CSS3</li>
<li>Netlify for hosting</li>
<li>Background image by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/aYEUXnVG8tg">Hamish Weir</a>.</li>
</ul>

This project has WIP status because I decided to work on the mobile version later.
